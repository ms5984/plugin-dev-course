# `Boolean Principle`
The Boolean principle is a section from a bigger mathematical concept called Boolean algebra. Boolean algebra was first introduced in 1847 by George Boole.

Boolean algebra consists of truth values. This means it can only have two states, e.g. `true` or `false`, which can also be denoted as `1` and `0` respectively. Like any mathematical concept, Boolean algebra also has operations. The three main operations are the conjunction (`AND`), the disjunction (`OR`) and the negation (`NOT`).

The principles from Boolean algebra (the Boolean principle) can be seen in every aspect of computing. A great example is the use of the main operations of Boolean algebra making logic gates inside of a CPU.
