# `2.1 Data types`
### What is a data type?
A data type is a way to classify data to the computer. It tells it how the programmer (you) intends to use that data, e.g. in the form of a number, a letter, a sentence.

The main data types are:
  - String ([See more](fundamentals/STRING.md))
  - Integer ([See more](fundamentals/INTEGER.md))
  - Real ([See more](fundamentals/REAL.md))
  - Character ([See more](fundamentals/CHARACTER.md))
  - Boolean ([See more](fundamentals/BOOLEAN.md))


### Data types in Java.
Java offers a more versatile approach to these main data types, providing you with appropriate variations of floating point types, as well as something called primitive and non-primitive types.

Java's 8 primitive data types:
  - boolean (See more)
  - char (See more)
  - byte (See more)
  - short (See more)
  - int (See more)
  - long (See more)
  - float (See more)
  - double (See more)
