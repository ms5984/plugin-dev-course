# `Byte (Java Implementation)`
The byte data type can store values ranging between -128 and 127 (inclusive).

In Java, bytes have a primtive type, `byte` and a wrapper class `Byte`.

### Usage
This data type is used to save memory in large arrays, it does this because a `byte` is 4 times smaller than an `int` in Java. It can also be used in place of an `int` - assuming your integer value doesn't exceed the bounds of a `byte`.

### Size
A byte, funnily enough, is 1 byte (8 bits) in size.

### Example
```java
byte a = 7
byte b = -13
```
