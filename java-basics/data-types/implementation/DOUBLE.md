# `Double (Java Implementation)`
The double data type is a double-precision IEEE 754 floating point (real). It's value range is unlimited.

In Java, doubles have a primtive type, `double` and a wrapper class `Double`.

### Usage
This data type is generally used for larger decimal values, where memory isn't extremely valuable. The double data type should also never be used for precise values.

### Size
A double is 8 bytes (64 bits) in size.

### Example
```java
double a = 873245.236D
double b = -234638.54D
```
