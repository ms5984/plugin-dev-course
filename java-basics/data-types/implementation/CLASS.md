# `Class (Java Implementation)`
At first classes in Java can be hard to wrap your head around, to understand what purpose they serve. An easy way to think about classes is like a template or blueprint defined by the user as a way to create an object.

### What is an object?
A Java object is an instance (defined below) of a Java class. Each object has an identity, a behaviour and a state.

The state of an object is stored in fields (defined below), while the methods (defined below) display and manage the object's behaviour. Objects are created at runtime from the classes (templates). You can create an object using the `new` keyword.

#### Definitions
##### Instance
If a class is just a blueprint, then you can think of the instance as the model of that blueprint. The model will contain everything that the blueprint outlined (the fields and methods), but any modifications at runtime made to the model (the instance), and not the blueprint (the class).

##### Field
A field is just like a normal variable, but it belongs to that class - that's all.

##### Method
A method is the same, it's like a normal subroutine, it just belongs to the class.
