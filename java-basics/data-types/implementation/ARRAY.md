# `Array (Java Implementation)`
Arrays in Java can be thought of as an ice tray for only one type of data; each array has a fixed length
(number of ice slots), and each slot can be occupied by at most one piece of data (one ice cube);
additionally, the order of the contents (slot of a given ice cube) is preserved. The array can only
ever contain that one type of data, e.g. an array of integers can only contain integers, no strings or floats.

### Usage
Arrays can be used to store several pieces of data of the same type.

### Example
```java
int[] array1 = new int[4]; // declare an int array with a length of 4
int[] array2 = new int[]{2, 5, 6}; // declare an int array with 3 values
```
