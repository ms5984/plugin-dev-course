# `Float (Java Implementation)`
The float data type is a single-precision IEEE 754 floating point (real). It's value range is unlimited.

In Java, floats have a primtive type, `float` and a wrapper class `Float`.

### Usage
This data type is used over a double to save memory in large arrays of floating point numbers. The float data type should also never be used for precise values.

### Size
A float is 4 bytes (32 bits) in size.

### Example
```java
float a = 3462.45F
float b = -89347.923F
```
