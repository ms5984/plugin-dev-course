# `Short (Java Implementation)`
The short data type can store values ranging between -32,768 and 32,767 (inclusive).

In Java, shorts have a primtive type, `short` and a wrapper class `Short`.

### Usage
This data type is used to save memory in large arrays, it does this because a `short` is 2 times smaller than an `int` in Java. It can also be used in place of an `int` - assuming your integer value doesn't exceed the bounds of a `short`.

### Size
A short, is 2 bytes (16 bits) in size.

### Example
```java
short a = 23457
short b = -4572
```
