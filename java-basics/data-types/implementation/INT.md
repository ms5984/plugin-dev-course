# `Int/Int32 (Java Implementation)`
The `int` data type can store values ranging between -2,147,483,648 (-2^31) and 2,147,483,647 (2^31 - 1) (inclusive).

In Java:
* Int32s have a primitive type: `int`, and a wrapper class: `Integer`.
* We write numbers that fall within the `int` range as they are (without thousands separator or decimal point): `10`.
##### This syntax is called an integer literal.
Though you may not include thousands separators (such as commas/full stops),
you may use underscores in place of separators if desired for clarity: `30_000_000`.
They will simply be ignored by the compiler.

### Usage
This data type is generally used to store integer values of modest range.

### Size
An int is 4 bytes (32 bits) in size.

### Example
```java
int a = 934653;
int b = -345897;
```
