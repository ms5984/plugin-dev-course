# `Character (Fundamentals)`
### What is a character?
A character (char for short) is a single character surrounded by apostrohpes (`''`). When we say character, we mean letters, numbers and symbols.

Some examples of characters are: `C`, ` `, `e`, `{`, `3`

The same as strings, we can store a number in a character, but remember that the computer is not treating it as an integer.

See how integers are implemented in Java [here]().
