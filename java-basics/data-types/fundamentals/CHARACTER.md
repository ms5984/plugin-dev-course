# `Character (Fundamentals)`
### What is a Character?
A Character (`char`) represents a single letter, number or symbol.

#### Storing digits in chars
Much the same as strings, we can store small numbers (specifically the digits 0-9) in a character, but remember,
the computer is no longer treating it as an integer.

See how characters are implemented in Java [here](../implementation/CHAR.md).
