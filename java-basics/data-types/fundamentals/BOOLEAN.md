# `Boolean (Fundamentals)`
### What is a boolean?
A boolean (bool for short) only has two potential values, `true` or `false`. To further understand booleans you must understand the [Boolean principle]().

Some examples of booleans are: `true`, `false`, `1`, `0`, `on`, `off`

Like anything, a string can technically hold a boolean value, but the computer will still only treat it as a string, not as a boolean.

See how integers are implemented in Java [here]().
