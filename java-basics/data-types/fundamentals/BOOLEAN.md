# `Boolean (Fundamentals)`
### What is a Boolean?
A Boolean represents something that can only ever be one of two potential values: `True` or `False`.
To further understand booleans, you must understand the [Boolean principle]().

Here are some examples of real-world states that represent boolean values:
* of a true-or-false trivia question: **True** or **False**
* of a bit in a computer: `1` or `0`
* of a light: **on** or **off**

Perhaps confusingly, a [string](./STRING.md) can contain a representation of a boolean.
It is important to know how this conversion--forward or backward--may affect your project.

See how Booleans are implemented in Java [here](../implementation/BOOLEAN.md).
