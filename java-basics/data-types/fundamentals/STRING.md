# `String (Fundamentals)`
### What is a string?
A string is 0 or more characters listed together inside ditto marks (`""`). They can contain any character that exists within the computing world (ASCII & Unicode).

An example of a string is `"Hello world"`. The length of this string is 11 (10 letters & 1 space).

We can have numbers as a string because they're characters that exist on a computer, e.g. `"34"`. But bare in mind that when working with that string, the computer will treat it only as a string, not as the number `34`. 

See how strings are implemented in Java [here](../implementation/STRING.md).
