# `Real (Fundamentals)`
### What is a real?
A real (also called floating point) is a fractional/decimal number (fractional meaning to represent part of a whole). They can be negative or positive, and can also be just a whole number.

Some examples of reals are: `6.33`, `-54.982`, `72`, `-9.0`

See how reals are implemented in Java [here]().
